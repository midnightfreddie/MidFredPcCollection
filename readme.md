# midnightFreddies PC Collections

Several times I've wished to share some of my PC collection scripts, but I 
made them at work. I've finally found an excuse to reimplement them 
outside of work. I want to force myself to learn the CIM cmdlets and try 
doing things via CIM/WMI instead of functional cmdlets, so I'll do PC 
collection info with CIM classes, instances and methods.

So far I just have `Test-MfPcConnection` and `Get-MfPcNbtStat` done.
The three top-folder scripts have examples on how to use them and output
to OutFile.csv in the local folder.
